Onboarding is currently painful and can improve with regards to:

* docs
* automation

Additionally, there are some other pain-points due to loose process definitions with regards to

* software development lifecycle
* CICD rules and automations
* code quality rules
* test requirements

---

# Brief

There should be a standardized process of required readings and set up steps that new SWE hires go through. So we are currently adding more documentation and automations to improve the process.

At onboarding time, SDLC should be clearly defined and understood by new hires.

---

# Requirements

- [X]  Day 1 Document
- [X] Software Engineer's Day 1 Document
  - [X] Development Machine Set up
  - [X] READMEs with ""Getting Started"" section with repo-specific instructions on all essential repositories
- [ ] All steps of setup are automated IF (1) it is reasonable to automate and (2) it should be abstracted away from the developer, some things are good to not abstract if developer should be familiar with the tool/dependency
- [ ] Automations should be compatible with (in priority order)
  - [ ] WSL2 Ubuntu LTS 22.04 on Windows 11
  - [ ] MacOS
  - [ ] Native windows (using Git BASH shell)
- [ ] Set a quarterly process of checking up on all onboarding documentation to make sure it is up to date
- [ ] Software development lifecycle is clearly defined in a document

# Timeline

We've already started this work and are aiming to complete this project by the end of Q1, March 31st 2024.

In the future, we'll probably have to do something like a quarterly check-in to make sure docs are up to date, and that automations work on new machines.

The previous `conceptual-design-service` was not aware of site-constraints, and attempted to handle too much of the deterministic geometric operations while generating mass models. We've found recently that the generation of geometries can be left to a deterministic algorithm, while the higher level orchestration/parameter generation for those geometry algorithms provides LLMs with a nice level of abstraction for generating diverse outputs while maintaining coherence/avoiding hallucination/keeping the context window lean.

---

# Brief

This project aims to build a system for mass model generation that is site constraint aware, and does not include the actual (grasshopper) implementation of the geometry generation.

# Requirements

  * This document outlines the rough project requirements. The scope has changed as a result of learnings that have come out of the past couple months, but the level of complexity of chat interactions is the same.
  * Current expected functionalities include,
    * Agent performs RAG with vector store of building codes
    * Agent falls back to web search if vector search doesn't provide valuable search results
    * Using site-constraints, the Agent generates parameters for the geometry algorithm(s) whose expected behavior(s) are documented

Currently, errors in the UI are not consistently handled or displayed to users, resulting in confusion, poor user experience, and difficulty in debugging. Implementing comprehensive error handling directly aligns with our OKR to enhance application reliability and user trust. It ensures smoother user interactions, better diagnostics, and faster resolution of UI issues.

---

# Brief

This feature involves implementing a centralized error-handling solution in a React and TypeScript environment. The implementation will include handling common UI errors gracefully, providing informative feedback to users, and ensuring all errors are logged clearly for developer troubleshooting.

---

# Requirements

* Implement an Error Boundary in React to catch and handle JavaScript errors occurring anywhere in the UI.
* Create a reusable Error Component to display user-friendly error messages and provide helpful suggestions.
* Set up global error handling using context or state management libraries (e.g.,  Zustand) to centrally manage error states.
* Ensure type-safety in error handling logic using TypeScript.
* Write unit tests and integration tests to validate error-handling logic.

Our current `commits` state tree has grown organically and now contains duplicated sources (`loadedCommits`, individual “*selected-commit*” atoms, ad-hoc flags for merging/operations, etc.).

* Pain points
  * **Coupling & duplication** – the same commit can live in 3 different slices, causing stale UI or race conditions (see “commit_id → merging operation → viewpoint scene” loop in the second diagram).
  * **Complex workflows** – creating, renaming, un-committing, and submitting a commit each trigger different Redux paths, making the yellow “operations” swim lane hard to follow.
  * **Inconsistent UX** – dropdowns and scene viewports don’t stay in sync; bulk operations (merge, discard) are hard to implement.
* Contributes to OKR **“Increase developer velocity by 30 %”** and **“Reduce production bugs related to state mis-sync to zero in Q3.”**

---

# Brief

We will **collapse all commit-related slices into a single normalised store (**`commitStore`) with declarative selectors and side-effect-free reducers.
*Blue* nodes in the diagram (e.g. `loadedCommit` container) become façade hooks; *yellow* nodes (operations) turn into actions. 
The refactor also revises the user workflow:

1. **Add commit to viewport** → validates existence → creates/overwrites a viewport entry (green nodes).
2. **Edit, merge, and discard** are expressed as *operations* on a single source of truth, rather than separate states.
3. **Submit** now fires one consolidated thunk (`commit/submitCommit`) that updates the name, persists to the backend, and clears local dirty flags.

Clearer boundaries enable us to integrate new features (branching, snapshots) with minimal disruption.

At the moment we use the native editing environment from our preferred CAD application (Rhino), and the logic engine runs within that environment.

Over time, we'd like to explore moving to a custom front end, which will give us more control over the user interactions, both in terms of functionality and aesthetics.

The project would start with an exploratory phased, testing different frameworks and building MVPs. Some immediately obvious candidates we should consider:

# Game Engines

* Unity
  * Natively C#, so highly compatible with our core codebase. 
  * Well documented, very popular, robust ecosystem and LLM training
  * Allows for WebGL Builds, for web deployment
  * Can run Rhino directly within Unity
  * Con: Has a licensing model, and is closed source
* Godot
  * More contemporary
  * Open Source
  * Partial C# support, but strongly encouraged to develop using their custom language ""GDScript""

# Web Frameworks

* React Three FIber
  * Built on ThreeJS
  * Same tech stack as our Concepting Tool, so there could be high re-use
  * On the desktop, could be packaged into an Electron application
  * Possible that interaction design will be a much bigger lift
  * We should test running the core logic directly within WASM

# Ground-Up 3D Application

* Could use C++ libraries such as Qt
* Could use C# libraries such as Avalonia
* Full freedom and customization, but also have to build everything from scratch",Planned,No priority,"Unity MVP[next],R3F MVP[unstarted],Core Tech Selection + UI Strategy Development[unstarted],Establish UI Framework[unstarted]",Keyan,,,,,,,6/20/2025 13:57:38,,6/20/2025 13:57:38,,,,Product,,No updates,,,,,,,,

Up to this point we've built several LLM proof of concepts. At this point it is becoming clear that they will be useful for our product in several ways, so the aim of this project is to explore and set a working foundation that we can build LLM features on top of.
